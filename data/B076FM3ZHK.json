    "description": "How to solder: 1. The first time to use iron, it will come out from the tip of smoke. The smoke will disappear in a short time, the smoke will never appear again. 2. Prepare solder and soldering iron. In particular, the tip must be kept clean, where the solder should be coated. 3. When soldering, when the tip is covered with oxide and black, you need to rub in the rosin rub, and use solder wire to it on the tin, to keep the tip of the tip of the 1 / 4--1 / 2 area is Bright on tin state. 4. Use soldering iron to heat the welding parts, such as PCB wires and pads, and keep the iron evenly heated. 5. When the temperature is high enough, place the wire at the joint and the solder will melt and flow freely. 6. Do not pull out the tip and use it in this way, which will shorten the service life of the heating element. 7. During soldering iron is connected to power, it should be placed on the electric iron frame, do not mess up, so as to avoid accidents. After turning off power, it should be fully cooled after around 20 minutes. The kit includes: 1* 60W adjustable thermoelectric soldering iron 5* different shapes of soldering iron head 1*12 grams (0.42 ounces) of solder wire 1* 12 grams (0.42 ounces) rosin 1* 1.5 m (59 inch) suction tin copper wire 1* stainless steel tweezers 1* Simple stainless steel electric iron stand 1x High temperature sponge 1x Desoldering Pump 1x Wishful pliers 1x small brush 1x Carry Bag 60W adjustable thermoelectric iron technical parameters Operating voltage 110V / 60HZ Maximum power: 60W In normal operation, 60W adjustable temperature soldering iron temperature adjustment range 200 \u2103 -450 \u2103 (392 \u2109 -842 \u2109)",
