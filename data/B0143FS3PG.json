    "description": "Yohimbine works on the alpha receptors. Alpha receptors inhibit fat breakdown, so wherever they are abundant, you have a harder time losing fat in that area. For example, they are in high concentration in men\u2019s lower back and abs and in women\u2019s hips and thighs. Yohimbine HCl acts as an alpha receptor blocker. Since alpha receptors inhibit fat breakdown, and Yohimbine HCl inhibits alpha receptors, the net result is that you get an INCREASE in fat breakdown. Thus, you get a significant increase in fat breakdown directly from an area that normally is the hardest place to lose it from. This is one reason why trainers like myself ALWAYS have my clients use this precontest!",
