    "description": "The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power planets that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer and more efficient plants become available so you're effectively allowing others to access to superior equipment. Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials like coat, oil, garbage, or uranium to power the plants, making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency. This family strategy board game is for 2 to 6 players and takes about two hours to play. Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.
