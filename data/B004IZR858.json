    "description": "The is an all-in-one solution for recording hands-free audio to both channels of your camcorder or DSLR as well as most devices with a 3.5mm mic-level input that cannot supply phantom power. It is a self-powered clip-on electret condenser mic designed for accurate voice reproduction in home and video webcasting applications such as presentations, interviews, dictation, and corporate video. The microphone's small, 21mm-long lightweight body allows for discrete placement with the included tie-clip while its 20-foot long cable gives you ample distance from your recording device. Featuring a 3.5mm dual mono TRS output connector, the mic sends audio to both the left and right channels of your recorder. Thanks to its omnidirectional polar pattern, the OLM-10 provides a uniform response that will not cause the bass-boosting proximity effect common with cardioid patterns, while allowing you to move freely without off-axis rejection causing a drop in volume. The in-line power switch allows you to quickly mute the microphone as well as preserve battery life when not in use. A windscreen for reduced noise and plosives, 1/4\" adapter, and LR44 battery are included.",
