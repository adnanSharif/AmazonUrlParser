Whether you're recording at home, on the road, or in the Himalayas, Yeti helps you produce studio-quality recordings every time.Blue Microphones tri-capsule technology gives you four distinct pattern modes to choose from:Yeti features studio controls for headphone volume, pattern selection, instant mute and microphone gain - putting you in charge of every level of the recording process. If you\u2019re experiencing distortion or feedback while recording an especially loud source, simply adjust the mic's sensitivity with the gain control. Or if you want to take a break in the middle of a podcast, use the instant mute button.",
