    "description": "This 3-piece kit contains TOPPIK's patented Spray Applicator and Hairline Optimizer for completely natural looking fiber application, and the TOPPIK Travel Size FiberHold Spray to further strengthen the bond between fibers and existing hair. These tools help frame the face perfectly and deliver precise coverage in focused areas of thinning for a completely natural look that lasts through wind, rain and perspiration. The FiberHold Spray also creates a natural looking shine, won't dry out your natural hair, and is formulated with panthenol to hydrate and strengthen. The Hairline Optimizer also features an innovative design that allows for even distribution of colored fibers and eliminates excess product for a clean finish. The Spray Applicator is also great to disguise parts, cover up roots and blend hair extensions. After applying and styling hair fibers, hold FiberHold spray bottle 4-8 inches from hair and use short, light sprays. Reapply as needed. By Toppik",
