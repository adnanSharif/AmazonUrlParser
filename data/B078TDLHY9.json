    "description": "The High-Speed Wireless Charging Stand The wireless evolution of Anker's world-famous technology uses a high-efficiency chipset and an internal cooling fan (the first of its kind) to provide the fastest possible wireless charge in its class. Note: Cooling fan makes a sound during normal charging operation. Power any wirelessly-charged device in your arsenal at an uninterrupted 5W. Charging power is boosted to 7.5W for iPhone (as fast as Apple's proprietary wall charger), while flagship Samsung phones get a 10W extra-fast charge. Twin charging coils let you watch videos in landscape orientation, or stand in portrait mode for web browsing and Face ID\u2014all while keeping the power flowing. Don't worry about taking your case off whenever you have to charge. PowerWave delivers charging power directly through cases up to 5 mm thick\u2014including Otterboxes. - iOS 11.2 required to access 7.5W fast charging for iPhone. - Quick Charge 3.0 wall charger with 12V / 1.5A output required for operation. - PowerWave is incompatible with the wall chargers provided with the phone by Apple and Samsung. - Metal attachments, popsockets, or credit cards will interfere with charging - Cases with metal inside, such as Pitaka, Evutec, and Spigen QNMP, will trigger the foreign object detection and interrupt charging. - The included AC adapter does not have an LED indicator, to minimize distractions. - 7.5W: iPhone X / iPhone 8 / iPhone 8 Plus (iOS 11.2 or later required) - 10W: Samsung Galaxy S9 / S9+ / S8 / S8+ / S7 / S7 edge / S6 edge+ / Note 5, LG G7 / G7+ / V30 / V30+, Sony Xperia XZ2 - 5W: Samsung S6/S6 edge, Google Nexus 6 / 5 / 4, LG G2 / G3 / G6...",
