    "description": "An ultra-fine layer of EXP Coating is bonded to the phosphor bronze wrap wire which is then wound onto the hex-shaped core wire. The result is a built-in barrier against the corrosion and wear that can quickly sap the life out of your strings and your sound. EXP coated phosphor bronze strings have a natural round wound feel and sound fresh and bright with a \"new string tone\" that lasts three to four times longer than traditional guitar strings.",
