With foldable cord, lightweight and portable design makes it a great travel companion to expand your laptop\u2019s USB 3.0 port into four. Fully backwards compatible with the USB 2.0/1.1 products. With TP-Link UH400, you can now transfer data at up to 10 times the speeds of the older USB 2.0 standards. Speeds of 5Gbps are a vast improvement over USB 2.0\u2019s 480Mbps top speed. It is also backwards compatible, allowing you the capability of using USB 2.0/1.1 products if need be. Please Note: 2.4Ghz wireless devices, such as wireless keyboard and mouse adapters, may not work in close proximity to USB 3.0 devices or hubs. Connecting to a USB 2.0 port is recommended. For a stable connection, don't use this hub with high power-consumption devices (the devices connected to the 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub must not exceed a combined current of 5 volts 900 mAh), such as external hard drives, tablets and other devices which require a higher power input.",
