    "description": "Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is the total weight of all solids (minerals, salts, or metals) that are dissolved in a given volume of water, expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L), or in parts per million (PPM). The higher TDS level in the water, the more the probability of harmful contaminants that can pose health risks or hinder the absorption of water molecules on the cellular level. TDS meter is great for all home and laboratory water testing applications. It can be widely used in water treatment industry, drinking water industry and household. Someone even will take the portable pen while they are traveling. The improved TDS meter tester is designed to test total dissolved solids in parts per million, electrical conductivity, and temperature either in Celsius degree or Fahrenheit degree. The TDS meter has transparent LCD screen display with 4 numerical figures and the corresponding physical units. The backlight design can help you to test the solutions even in a dim light place. If you are drinking an unqualified drinking water, the backlight will turn red, showing the number over 40 to give you warning. Are you tired of using something that is short life span and buying again and again? Here is the answer for you. The only thing you need is to replace the battery and you can use your TDS meter for life long. Measurement range: TDS 0-9990ppm, Conductivity 0-9990 \u00b5s/cmScope of temperature application: 0.1-50.0\u00b0C (32.0-122.0\u00b0F).
