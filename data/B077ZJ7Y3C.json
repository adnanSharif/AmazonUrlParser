Graphene is the newest, strongest and thinnest material. As a conductor of heat it outperforms all other known materials. Our bodies radiate far infrared energy through the skin at 3 to 50 microns, with most output at 9.4 microns. Graphene\u2018far infrared rays\u2019 have a wavelength 6~19 microns, which compatible with the human body and can be easily absorbed. Far Infrared Ray are waves of energy, which positively help activating body systems and functions. FIR Detoxifies Your Body Far Infrared Therapy Promotes Blood Circulation FIR increases blood circulation and oxygen FIR Help Chronic Fatigue FIR Reduces Pain and Stiffness(reducing muscle spasms, muscle soreness, and relief for rheumatoid arthritis. FIR Relieves Back Pain Symptoms FIR Boosts Your Immune System Heating material: Graphene heating film Waist line: 7.8''-47.2'' Technical principle: The graphene heating film produces pure far infrared light waves Powered way : USB Powered Highest Surface Temperature: 120\u2109 1:Turn on the power by pressing the power button. 2:3 temperature setting: Low setting (blue light).
