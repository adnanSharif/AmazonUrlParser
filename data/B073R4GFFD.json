    "description": "GET FIT WITH BETTER DATA Want to know if you\u2019re burning fat and gaining muscle? Or whether you\u2019re actually losing weight, not just water? The QardioBase smart scale makes it all possible. Qardio Base 2 measures body mass index (BMI) and body composition, including body fat percentage and muscle, water and bone mass, for a complete picture of heath that goes far beyond weight. SET AND TRACK GOALS Set goals and monitor your daily or weekly progress with our intelligent results tracking. Tired of obsessing over the numbers on a scale? Switch to Smart Feedback mode, which uses emojis (smileys) instead of numbers to recognize progress. The scale includes Haptic Feedback, which uses a gentle vibration to confirm when a measurement is complete. Also works with MyFitnessPal to track nutrition.
