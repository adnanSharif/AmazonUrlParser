    "description": "The new and improved Palio Master 2 is the perfect bat for players that are looking to take their game to the next level and need a bat that will give them a high level of spin and power without losing control. It is recommended to players that have mastered the basic strokes and are now looking to add power, learn more advanced strokes and test their skills in competitions. The ITTF approved Palio CJ8000 rubbers are well known for their ability to generate spin while maintaining a good level of control and feeling due to their softer sponge. The tacky rubbers will help you produce topspin, backspin and sidespin with ease. The all wood Palio x ETT Master 2 blade has been completely redesigned to improve quality and feeling. It features a flared handled that is very comfortable to hold and it provides the perfect combination between power and control. The Palio Master 2 is a terrific allround table tennis bat. A free Palio bat case is also included to help you protect the bat and keep the rubbers clean.",
