        "You are looking to purchase this band now: #5 Blue - 65 to 175 Pounds 2.5\" *4.5mm - The toughest and most resistant one, this one gives maximum resistance in tough exercises like squats and deadlifts. Also perfect for people needing more help with their pull ups and bar muscle ups. They provide the most assistance for heavier body types as well.",
        "Here are the details of all the other bands we offer: #1 Red- 10 to 35 Pounds (1/2 \" *4.5mm), #2 Black - 30 to 60 Pounds (3/4 \" *4.5mm), #3 Purple- 40 to 80 Pounds (1.25 \" *4.5mm), #4 Green - 50 to 125 Pounds (1.75 \" *4.5mm), #5 Blue - 65 to 175 Pounds (2.5\" *4.5mm)",
        "Many people buy more than one band and combine the bands for most efficient training. Combining bands gives you 3 levels of assistance - one with the thicker band, one with the thinner band, and one with both bands. This allows you to do sets where you start with the thicker band and then add the thinner band to squeeze out a few additional reps. As your strength gradually increases, you can switch from double bands to the thicker band and then the thinner band alone.",
        "Whether you are just starting out with pull ups or you are an athlete working on regaining or enhancing your strength, the WODFitters resistance band will help you take your pull up and chin up training to the next level. Try it for 60 days. If during this time you don't love it or don't feel it was worth every penny of your investment today, we give you your full payment back. No questions asked! We offer a 100% satisfaction Guarantee!"
