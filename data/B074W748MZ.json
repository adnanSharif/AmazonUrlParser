    "description": "Over-the-head headphones are just like hats: what fits you might not fit somebody else\u2019s head. TaoTronics combats this reality by providing a Bluetooth headset that adjusts to best suit the user\u2019s physiognomy. While the ear cups swivel and the headband extends to nestle on heads of different sizes and shapes, the memory foam ear pads feel soft, yet snug on the ears. Wireless headphones are great and nothing beats the convenience of streaming audio without the nuisance of wires. But what if the battery runs out? In addition to providing over a day of wireless music playback or a 3 month standby time after only 2 hours of charging, the TaoTronics Over-the-Ear Headset connects via the included 3.5 mm cord for uninterrupted audio reproduction. Make every tune, podcast, or movie memorable with the TaoTronics Foldable Earphones with On-Ear Controls. A more stable, easier to pair CSR chip and two 40 mm large-aperture drivers make for an unprecedentedly good audio quality, while the snug acoustic seal cushions block outer noise for a more immersive reproduction.
