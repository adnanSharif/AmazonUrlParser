    "description": "There are so many variations on Clay products on the market. Some suck up all of the moisture in your hair and leave you with an unhealthy dry look, others are far too greasy and tough to work with. Holds range from super heavy/high holding, gravity defying, to light and wispy. Lockhart's Professional Matte Clay finds a happy middle ground to these extremes. It's truly a Medium holding Matte Clay which allows your hair to move naturally while holding it's desired shape. The shine that's provided is a nice healthy matte finish. All it takes is a few small scoops of product to provide a nice textured hairstyle that's perfect for a night on the town.",
