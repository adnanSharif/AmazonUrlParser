    "description": "Rid your fish of ich quickly and effectively with API LIQUID SUPER ICK CURE Freshwater and Saltwater Fish Medicatio. API LIQUID SUPER ICK CURE Freshwater and Saltwater Fish Medicatio works quickly to heal freshwater fish of icthyophthirius (\"Ich\") or Cryptocaryon, highly contagious parasitic diseases. Ich, also called white spot disease, is a highly contagious and destructive, microscopic parasite that burrows into gill and skin tissue, causing severe damage and secondary infections. Early symptoms include white spots, darting and scratching against surfaces while more advanced stages can cause labored breathing. This freshwater fish treatment not only helps cure Ich, but it also provides a synthetic slime coat that helps protect against secondary infection, where the natural slime coating of the fish has been disturbed by the parasite. Use at the first sign of \"Ich\" or white spots. Some scaleless fish are sensitive to this medication, so treat them with 1/2 the normal dose. Some saltwater invertebrates, such as corals, may be sensitive to this product, so it is not recommended for reef aquariums. This medication will cause a slight discoloration of water which can be easily removed by adding activated carbon to the filter. Dose according to directions on product packaging and label. This treatment can be used in freshwater or saltwater aquariums. With API Aquarium products, it\u2019s easy to keep a beautiful saltwater, freshwater or reef aquarium.
