    "description": "The Menstrual Cup is reusable, earth-friendly, easy-to-use, and economical. It is made of non-latex, medical-grade silicone. Material: non-latex and medical-grade silicone Size: 1.4x1.6 inch /1.7x1.95 inch Weight: 11g/16g Color: Pink To disinfect your Ruby Cup, rinse it thoroughly and boil it for five minutes. Make sure that the menstrual cup is completely immersed in water while boiling. You can wear your Lily Cup Compact for up to 12 hours, and we recommend that you empty your cup 2-3 times per 24 hour period. Generally speaking, the lighter your flow, the less frequent the changes. But on those heavy days, you may need to empty your cup more often. With time and practice you will be able to gauge how often you personally need to empty your cup.",
