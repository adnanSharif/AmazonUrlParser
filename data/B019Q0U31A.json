    "description": "Micro USB The Premium Heavy-Duty Charging Cable \u2022 Faster and safer charging with our advanced technology \u2022 10 million+ happy users and counting PowerLine+ may be the last cable you'll ever need. Proven to last at least 5 times as long as other cables, it boasts a bend tolerance 10 times higher. It is simply one of the most durable cables, ever. Exceptional tensile strength is provided by a aramid fiber core, double nylon-braiding and precision laser welding. PowerLine+ is built to withstand any yanking, twisting, stretching, or dropping that it might possibly be subjected to. Includes an innovative felt pouch which allows you to adjust cable length for any situation. Close to your wall charger? Wind up PowerLine+ inside the pouch to avoid cables trailing across the floor. Low quality charging cables can reduce charging speeds by over 40%. PowerLine+ is designed with a thick wire gauge which reduces resistance and ensures maximum charging speed. At Anker, we believe in our products. That's why we back them all with an 18-month warranty and provide friendly, easy-to-reach support.",
