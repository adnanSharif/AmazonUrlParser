    "description": "Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Lotion helps visibly improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of stretch marks. Pure cocoa butter and shea butter, natural oils, collagen, elastin, and lutein keep skin moisturized and supple for 48 hours, allowing skin to stretch more easily. Widely recommended for stretch marks during and after pregnancy or weight fluctuation. This non-greasy lotion is ideal for all over body use, in place of your regular moisturizer. *IRI INFOSCAN 52 WEEKS ENDING 7/19/17 F/D/MX UNITS **Based on an 8 week in-home trial by 102 female panelists aged 18 to 49",
