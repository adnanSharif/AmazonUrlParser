(A voltage converter is needed to transfer the power supply to US use first if you want to use this air purifier beyond the US.)2.Please check the filter's color to relieve your concern on whether the device is purifying the air.3. To be Ozone-free, this Levoit Air Purifier is NOT AN IONIZER and does NOT USE UV-C LIGHT. Ionic air purifier emits negatively charged ions into the atmosphere of a room. As a result, a small amount of ozone is produced. UV-C light systems will produce \"photolytic\" ozone when UV-C hits oxygen (O2) molecules. Ozone is an important part of the atmosphere, but ozone is harmful for the lungs at ground level.4. Always allow 15 in. (38 cm) of clearance on all sides of the purifier.",
