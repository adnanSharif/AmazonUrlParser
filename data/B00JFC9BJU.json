        "Includes 12 pairs of banana plugs, which are meant for attaching to speaker wire and supplying a high-quality signal path from audio components like a speaker to an audio/video receiver, amplifier or other professional sound application.",
        "Compatible with bare wire, spades, or other banana plugs, and work with 8-18 AWG speaker wire. Connectors & crimping teeth are coated in corrosion-resistant 24K gold-plating for lasting, for secure fits with clarity, natural sonic accuracy and no distortion. A wider base minimizes shorting for maximum signal transfer, and a 2-piece screw-on design makes for reliable termination/reuse.",
        "Simply connect existing speaker wires to a banana plug through its bottom piece (step-by-step installation guide included). Self-crimping teeth make for easy one-time installs, and a low profile build only sticks out 1.",
        "The heavy-duty plugs are color coded, distinguishing left from right to enable matching polarity. Fast-lock is a great plug-and-play alternative to using bare wire when connecting devices, taking away the hassle of crimping or soldering.",
        "Each plug has a female banana plug connector on the bottom, allowing you to hook up speakers to a single output."
