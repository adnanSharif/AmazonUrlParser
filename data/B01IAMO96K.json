However, today's culture of cubicles, sunscreen, and near-round-the-clock indoor living minimizes our exposure to natural sunlight for the needed period of time for sufficient Vitamin D to form. Supplementing with Nature's Bounty Vitamin D3 is an easy way to increase your daily intake of this important nutrient.",
        "ALTERNATIVE VITAMIN D SOURCE: Lack of exposure to sunlight may reduce Vitamin D levels in the body, especially during winter or in northern climates. Additionally, skin-protecting sunscreen can reduce your body\u2019s ability to meet its daily Vitamin D needs, even during summer.",
