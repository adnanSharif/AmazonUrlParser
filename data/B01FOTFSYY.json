    "description": "Memento Mori - \"Remember your mortality\" Stemming from the medieval Latin theory and practice of reflection on mortality, it has been a ubiquitous part of human culture for centuries. From the philosophical to the artistic, the fascination, fear and appreciation of death has consistently captivated and cultivated our imagination. Many practitioners of this theory kept with them, artifacts or keepsakes which served as a reminder that the only thing certain in life, was death. Many of these items were often objects (watches, necklaces) in the shape of skulls. The low-poly design represents a simplistic one. The bare \"bones\" of 3D creation and graphic art, the first steps of animation can be interpreted as the beginning of 'virtual' life. Many historians believe that playing cards represented a deeper, esoteric meaning, that each suit was one of the four seasons. Each card within a suit was one of the thirteen phases of the moon. The fifty-two cards in a deck would represent the fifty-two weeks of the year and together, this would represent just one year of your life. A constant reminder of our fleeting time on earth. \"This deck is my Memento Mori.\" - Chris",
