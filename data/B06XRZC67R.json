        "EXTRA WIDE BANDS: Our RIGID EDITION BFR Bands are 2 inches wide and designed to offer superb restriction of blood flow through the working limb to the targeted muscles. These Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) bands reduce oxygen supply to the muscles in order to pre-fatigue slow twitch muscle fibers and diminish their response to workout loads, but to enable fast twitch muscle fibers to respond quickly to exercise training loads, resulting in faster lean muscle growth.",
        "INCREASED FACTORS FOR MUSCLE GROWTH: Studies show BFR training can increase muscle protein synthesis, NOS-1 expression and mTOR signaling, resulting in increased muscle growth. The studies also show BFR training can boost muscle growth and enhance potential for muscle gain by reducing Myostatin concentrations.",
        "EXTRA-STRONG AND SUPER-COMFORTABLE BFR BANDS: Made of extra strong hook and loop fastener material combined with a tightly woven metal slider and added comfort liner, the RIGID EDITION BFR training bands are easy to strap up, effortless to release as soon as the exercise is completed, and exceptionally comfortable on the working limb. Each BFR Bands\u2019 order comes with 2 bands to allow you to exercise both legs or both arms at the same time.",
        "The Arms version is 2 inches wide x 18 inches long. Comes with a free BFR ebook."
